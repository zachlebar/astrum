# Fastrum

A fork of Astrum which adds Figma integration and per-component CSS support. Unlike Astrum which is designed to create an end-of-project client deliverable, Fastrum is meant to be used during a project to facilitate collaboration between the design and development teams.

Astrum is a lightweight pattern library designed to be included with any web project. It's built by the fine folks at No Divide Studio. For more information on how Astrum works, checkout their repo: https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum.
